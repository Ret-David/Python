# Write a pseudo code to design a program that removes the duplicate numbers in a list
#     and prints the unique numbers only. For example, with the input list
#     [1, 2, -2, 1, 0, 2, 4, 0], the program prints 1, 2, -2, 0, 4.

# ======= My Pseudo Code =======
# start with provided list
# create an empty output_list

# if step through input_list
#     and append to the output_list if it doesn't exist

# print format by stepping through the list values for screen output

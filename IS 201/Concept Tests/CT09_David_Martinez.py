# Write a pseudo code to design a program that returns I-th largest value
#     in a list. For example, with the input list [3, 2, 8, 10, 5, 23]
#     and I = 4, the program prints the value 5 as it is 4 th largest value.

# ========== My Pseudo Code ==========
# >> 5 is in index 4 position but is the 3rd largest value
# >> largest value is in index 5 position

# variable = input list values
# variable = I-th largest value
# variable = unsorted output for index position I-th
# variable = sorted output for nth largest value
# print I-th value
# print nth value
# print largest value in index location
